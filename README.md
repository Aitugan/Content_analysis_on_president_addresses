# TF IDF for KZ president addresses
### Background
Kazakhstan has a website ["Official Information Source of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan"](https://primeminister.kz/en/address), which publishes "Addresses of the President to the people of Kazakhstan". In these addresses, the President talks about the conclusions of the past year and the plans for the following year.

### Problem
These addresses are very long and written in a rather complicated language. It would be difficult for an ordinary person to take the time to read and understand the entire address.

### Solution
Why read the whole address when you can highlight the top phrases in each message?
